Oct. 26.â€”After   Visitation of the Prior and Convent of Chirbury  the 
                    Bishop  directs them to enclose their buildings, and check the 
                    access of  women   and   others which   has  caused  notorious 
                    scandals.  Necessary conferences with laymen  on business may 
                    be held in  the Parish  Church or graveyard.   Owing   to their 
                    debts their number  must not be increased without his sanction, 
                    nor the rules of silence disregarded; nor must the Prior absent 
                    himself from  cloister, refectory, or dormitory.  No  property 
                    must  be alienated.  Canons  of doubtful  antecedents must not 
                    go  outside the enclosure without  trustworthy companionship. 
                    Report  must  be  made  of  the punishments   of those  of ill- 
                    repute.
