No. 1378. [circa 1345]. MEMORANDUM relating to a claim brought by Roger de Breynton', canon of the church of Hereford, against Thomas Trillek and Walter Carles, executors of the will of Adam, late bishop of Winchester. The said Roger de Breynton, executor of the will of Richard de Swynesfeld', formerly bishop of Hereford, stated that the said Thomas Trillek and Walter Carles together with John, bishop of Hereford, Roger de Breynton himself, John de Usk, and Nicholas de Waerwent, coexecutors with them of the will of the late bishop of Winchester, owed to him a sum of five hundred pounds which they unjustly withheld. Roger de Breynton' further maintained that the said bishop, in the name of Adam, then bishop of Hereford, had bound himself in writing at Sugwas on the twenty-seventh day of March in the year 1318 in the sum of one hundred pounds to Roger himself, and to Richard de Hamenasche, Robert de Ikelesham, and John de la Ffelde, canons of Hereford. The said bishop Adam on the first day of February in the year 1319/20 at Shenyngfeld had again bound himself in writing to the same persons in the sum of four hundred pounds, to be paid at specified terms. The said bishop Adam had failed to discharge these obligations during his lifetime; as a result of the delay, the said Roger de Breynton' had incurred a loss of a thousand pounds. He produced the two documents to which he had referred. The executors through Nicholas de Rook confessed that they could not gainsay the written bonds, and agreed that the said Roger de Breynton' should recover from, then the debt and losses. The said Roger de Breynton however acquitted them of the losses he had incurred, and announced that he would nullify the documents on settlement of the debt. Latin.
