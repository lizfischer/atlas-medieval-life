Jan. 30.—The   Bishop certifies the Court of Canterbury that—though 
                          the Bishop of  Llandaff had  not brought  the matter of  the 
                          tithes of the Forest of Dean  before him—he   had summoned 
                          the Rector of Bicknor  to appear and  answer  to the charges 
                          brought against him.   But on  the appointed day, the Rector 
                          being present, no representative of the Bishop  of Llandaff 
                         appeared  to prosecute the case. 

            A.D.  1326.
