Nov. 12.â€”Richard    de Hathertnge, Precentor  of Hereford, and  Arch- 
                                     deacon of  Chester, has professed his  readiness to resign the 
                                     Precentorship  (as provided  by the  Papal  Constitution Exe- 
                                     crabilis) should it be proved that the Precentor  has the cure 
                                     of souls.  The  Bishop  decides that the Precentorship ts with- 
                                     out cure of souls, and may  therefore be retained.
