1121 1 December 1335 Hampton Lucy (Hampton Episcopi). Mandate to the archdeacon of Worcester or his official. As his obliged by his pastoral office he proposes, God willing, personally to visit the clergy and people of the archdeaconry. He is to bring to their notice and to warn religious and others of the archdeaconry whom it may concern, lest they should excuse themselve on account of ignorance, to prepare for his visitation, to be undertaken in the archdeaconry and throughout the diocese as soon as possible and at an appropriate time. On the bishop's authority they are to denounce all with churches, portions or appropriations, those receiving tithes in alien churches or parishes, those having annual pensions, as well as to all rectors of the archdeaconry who either there or elsewhere hold several churches, benefices or cures (plures tenentibus ecclesias, beneficia ve curata), those also who after the Council of Lyons [1274] have been instituted to parish churches and have not secured ordination as priests within a year from the assumption of their rule over such, also those holding chapels, chantries or oratories who claim to celebrate divine service within the limits of another parish, that when they are cited they are to exhibit the special or canonical right that they may have in this respect. They are to intimate to the same that they will be cited to carry out the above with a shorter term and that now they are to be given warning by him subject to an extended dlay (et quod nunc sunt per vos ut premittitur premuniendi sub dilacione diffusa). Having a care for the indemnity of his jurisdiction he warns the archdeacon and his official, firstly, secondly and thirdly and in virtue of their obedience, not to do anything by themselves or by others to the prejudice of his ordinary jurisdiction or of his visitation in the archdeaconry or elsewhere in the diocese, whether secretly, openly or in any other manner. They are to inform him of their action in the matter by Christmas. A similar mandate was addressed to the archdeacon of Gloucester or his official.
