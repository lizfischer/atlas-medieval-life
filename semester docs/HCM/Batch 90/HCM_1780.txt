DEFINITIVE SENTENCE pronounced by the Official of the Court of Canterbury in a dispute between Thomas de Penebrugg', clerk, and John, bishop of Llandaff, concerning the presentation of the former to the rectory of Avene in the diocese of Llandaff. The document recites that the said Thomas had been presented to the church of the Blessed Mary of Avene by the true patron thereof, but that the bishop of Llandaff had refused to admit and institute him thereto. Whereupon the said Thomas had appealed to the Court of Canterbury. The libellus produced by him is quoted. The bishop maintains in his "justification" that the assertions made in the libellus are not true. He states that some time before the presentstion of the said Thomas, magister John Nicholas, clerk, was presented to the chureh of Avene, then vacant, and a suit was begun at the latter's request to remove a certain John Toppe, then incumbent de facto, out of his possession of the church. This suit continued for a long time. The presentation of the said Thomas was made whilst the suit was still pending; and so the bishop could not accept it, especially since his hands were tied by an inhibition of the Court of Canterbury. Against this 'justification', the said Thomas replied that the suit had been terminated, and that the said John Nicholas had renounced his right to the church, and had allowed John Toppe to have peaceful possession of it. The said John Toppe had then resigned his rectory. All this had taken place before the said Thomas was presented to the bishop by dominus Licent' de Morgan, knight, the true patron of the church. The sentence of the official of the Court of Canterbury is that the plea of the said Thomas is well-founded. He admits him to the said church and institutes him rector and decrees that he shall be inducted into corporal possession. Given in the church of the Blessed Mary of the Arches, London. Latin.
