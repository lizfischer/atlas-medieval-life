LETTER of Adam, bishop of Hereford, addressed to the dean and chapter of Hereford as collectors in the city, deanery, and archdeaconry of Hereford of the tenth for six years lately imposed by Pope Clement V, The bishop quotes a writ he has received from King Edward II dated 31 August 1317 which says that, since one the first day of August last part, the king ordered that the remainder of  the money of the first year of the tenth for six year imposed in the Council of Vienne and lent to the King by Pope John XXII, should be paid into his treasury to meet urgent affairs, the bishop is to comply with thius order with all diligence and speed. The bishop is to inform the king's treasurer and chamberlain at Westminster on the morrow of the feast of Saint Michael of what he has done in the matter, and to give them the names of those deputed by him for the collection of the tenth, and further the names of all those who had been deputed for the collection in the diocese after the imposition of the said tenth. The bishop therefore exhorts the dean and chapter of Hereford to apply themselves diligently to the collection and payment of the first year's portion of the tenth for six years, and to compel those who have not yet paid the money to do so under pain of ecclesiastical censure,  Given at Evesham, Latin.
