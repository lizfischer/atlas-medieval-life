355 Undated Commission to the [rural] dean of Gloucester. Because the archdeaconry of Gloucester is vacant owing to the resignation of M. J[ohn] de Usk, by reason of an exchange with Ds. R[oger] de Breynton for the rectory of Hanbury-by-Droitwich (Hembury iuxta Wichium),(75) the bishop has conferred it on the said Roger. The dean is to see that either he or his proctor is put in possession of certain houses in Gloucester (domorum in villa Glouc' situatarum racione dicti archidiaconatus debitarum)(76) and of all the rights and appurtenances of the archdeaconry. (75) Usk was instituted 25 May 1331 (no. 140) and the exchange took place 21 June 1331 (nos. 208-9). (76) See Worcester Administration, pp. 31, 39n.
