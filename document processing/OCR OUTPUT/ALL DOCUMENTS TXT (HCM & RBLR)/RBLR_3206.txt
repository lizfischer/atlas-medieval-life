179 9 November 1332 London. Commission for Ds. Roger de Breynton, archdeacon of Gloucester, and Ds. Adam de Herwynton, rector of Tredington (Tredinton), canons of Hereford. Because he is going overseas at the king's command on arduous business of the realm and cannot therefore attend to the administration of the spiritualities of the diocese, the bishop for the duration of his absence appoints them his vicars, jointly and severally, in all matters pertaining to the office of the vicariate, with the power of canonical coercion.
