The Bishop's Proctors in the suit against the Earl of Gloucester were 
                         Robert de Kemseye and John de Hampton,  of whom  the former 
                         was removed in the octave of St. Hilary. 

                      Episcopus  ponit loco suo in  placito predicto Robertum de 
                  Kemeseye, vel Johannem  de Hamptone:  postea Episcopus ammovit 
                  Robertum  de Kemeseye, apud Wyntoniam, in Octabis Sancti Hillarii 
                  et posuit loco suo.  .
