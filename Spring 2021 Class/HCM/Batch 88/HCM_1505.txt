RETURN by the Prior of Kermerdyn to a mandate of D [avid], bishop of St. David's, issued to the prior of Kedewelly, dominus John, rector of the church of Penbray, the said prior of Kermerdyn, and dominus Gregory, perpetual vicar of Landesteffan, which mandate the said prior of Kermerdyn received on IX Kalends February. The mandate is here quoted in full. The bishop's mandate was made public to Walter de la Boxe and magister Richard called de Monem', with a large number of people present and also the prior of Kedewelly, in the Priory of Kedewelly, and in other suitable places. When they attempted to announce the mandate in the church of Saint Ismael' and to restore magister Maurice to the corporal possession of that church, the said Walter and magister Richard made armed resistance and laid hands on the proctors of the said magister Maurice and would not allow them to remain on that land. For this reason, the prior has excommunicated the said Walter and the said magister Richard. Given at Kermerdyn. Latin. Chipped seal.
