Mar. 14.-Mandate of Pope Clement VI to the archbishop of Narbonne and others to restore to Joanna, daughter and heiress of Philip de Middelton, the townships and goods un justly detained from her by the bishop of Hereford and the prior of Sneyd. Philip de Middelton, lord of Middelton and other townships, on a plea of owing suit of court and homage, had been violently deprived of the townships and their profits by Adam, bishop of Hereford, and the prior. Joanna, his daughter and heiress, appealed to the Apostolic See, and her case, after many hearings, was finally remitted by the pope to Bernard de Novo Dampno, who, on the failure of the defendants to appear, decided in her favour.
