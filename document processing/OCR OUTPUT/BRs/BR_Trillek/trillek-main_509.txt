Feb. 23.—Writ    to the bishop to  distrain on  the goods of John  de 
                                       Westdene,  rector of Hopesay,  to recover £6,  which  the said 
                                       John  received from the estate of the  late I'homas de Clonne. 
                                       The  bishop's return states that  John  de  Westdene  holds no 
                                       benefice tn the diocese, so that no distraint can be made.
