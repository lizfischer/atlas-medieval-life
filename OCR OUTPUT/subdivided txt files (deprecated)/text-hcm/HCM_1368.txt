LETTER of Adam, of Hereford, addressed to the dean and chapter of Hereford, stating that he has received a complaint from dominus Bartholomew de Badelesmere, that, in spite of a royal writ ordertng the payment to the said dominus Bartholomew of three hundred pounds out of the money for the first year of the tenth for six years collected in the diocese of Hereford, this had not been done, The bishop himself had exhorted the dean and chapter and also the abbot and convent of Wigmore, collectors of the tenth for the archdeaconry of Salop to pay the sum to the messengers of dominus Bartholomew but when these messengers had come to them at great expense, they had put them off on the pretext that no â€”receipt was given for the payment, and that the messengers had no letter of authority from dominus Bartholomew, The bishop exhorts the dean chapter to deliver the money to the messengers and to accept a receipt from then. The receipt of dominus Bartholomew will be sent on his coming to London in a few days time, Unless they do this, Dominus Bartholomew will take strong action against them. If the dean and chapter will not heed their bishop's words, they are to bring the money to London using their own messengers, who will then receive a receipt for the payment Since the messengers of dominus Bartholomew have entirely exhausted their own funds in delaying at Hereford, the dean and chapter are to make them a loan of forty shillings out of the tenth for the expenses of their return to London, Given at Heiebur' near London, Latin.
