Oct. 30.â€”The   Archbishop  of Canterbury  laments the prevalence  of 
                                      jury in  the law-courts, and directs that notice be given in 
                                   Churches  that all perjured persons would  be excommunicated, 
                                   and  the power  of absolving them  reserved to the Archbishop 
                                   himself.
