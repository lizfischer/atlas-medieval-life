Jan. 16.â€”In   the matter of  a suit before the Dean  of Hereford, in 
                                     which  Cecil de Cary,  claiming to have  been presented to the 
                                     Vicarage of  Wormbridge,  sought  to be instituted in place of 
                                     William   Brayn,  the  holder of  the benefice, the latter has 
                                     appealed  to the Bishop.   The  Bishop,  therefore, forbids the 
                                     Dean  to act further  im the case  until the appeal  has  been 
                                     tried.
