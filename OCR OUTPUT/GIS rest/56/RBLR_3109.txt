829 Undated Commission to M. W[illiam] de Bosco, rector of T[wyning]. Ds. Roger de Breynton, archdeacon of Gloucester, has complained that there were many notable defects in the buildings (domibus) of his archdeaconry and other appurtenances at the death of Joceus [de Kynebauton], which still exist and cannot be rectified without great expense. By right and custom such repairs were the responsibility of the said Joceus, and the archdeacon asks for remedy.(3) The commissary is to hold an enquiry by a sworn body of men in a position to know, summoning those affected, as well as others, and is to establish either by enquiry or composition the full amount of reparation, which is to be applied to that purpose within such time as he determines. At the request of the said Archdeacon Roger he is to certify the bishop of his action by letters patent. (3) See nos. 56, 665, 680, 681.
