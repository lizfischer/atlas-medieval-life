April  22.â€”The   Bishop  instructs the  Dean  of  Stottesdon to cite 
                                    Hamo,   Vicar of  Stottesdon, to show  cause why  the  Abbot 
                                    and  Convent of  Shrewsbury, as  patrons, should not appoint 
                                    Walter  de  Finningham    to the Vicarage,  since Hamo   had
