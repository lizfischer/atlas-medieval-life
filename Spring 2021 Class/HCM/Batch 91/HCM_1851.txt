The said dean and chapter appeared at St. Paul's London through their proctors John de Barewe and John Gorewy, clerks, before magister William de Halstede, commissary of dominus R., bishop of London, collector of the said tenth with his colleague the bishop of Lincoln. For the second year of the said tenth, the said dean and chapter rendered an account for three hundred and ninety-eight pounds nineteen shillings and tenpence halfpenny. Of this sum they paid three hundred and sixty-five pounds, fifteen shillings snd threepence. They were excused in respect of four pounds ten shillings and five pence three farthings in respect of certain benefices which were taxed twice by mistake; and of ten pounds eighteen shillings and nine pence three farthings as the result of the moderating of the excessive tax on some benefices formerly by the bishops of Winchester and Lincoln. The dean and chapter were allowed ten marks for their expenses. There remained eleven pounds two shillings which they asserted to be in the hands of certain debtors whose names were given in the account.
