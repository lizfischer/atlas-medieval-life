Feb. 23.â€”Mandate    to levy the fifty shillings still due from Ralph, 
                                    rector of Eastham,   surprise being expressed  at the  delay to 
                                    do  so.  The   bishop sends  ten  shillings, but can  raise  no 
                                    more  at present.
