June 5.-Whereas the dilapidations of the episcopal buildings of the see of Winchester and the deficiencies in the chattels are very great, William, bishop of Winchester, makes an agreement the avoidance of further disputes with the executors of bishop Adam. They engage to leave all growing crops and live and dead stock in the bishop's manors with flocks of sheep elsewhere, to surrender silver vessels worth £250 and various arrears and debts, and to pay £50 for the appurtenances for the chapel. The bishop agrees to give the executors a formal acquittance for the dilapidations and deßciencies and for the tenths paid to the king.
