May  15.â€”Request   to the  bishop to make  known  in  the diocese the 
                                      measures   adopted  by  the  king for the security  of scholars 
                                      wishing   to reside at Oxford.    In consequence  of their feud 
                                      with  the people  of the  town the  scholars have  deserted the 
                                      place, and to enable them  to return the king has granted them 
                                      full  indemnity  for  all felonies and  offences, has forbidden 
                                      either party  to  indulge tn insults and  bickerings, and  will 
                                      devise a  scheme for future  securtty and peace.  He  considers 
                                      an  educated clergy to be the chief support of religion and  of 
                                      good  government.)
