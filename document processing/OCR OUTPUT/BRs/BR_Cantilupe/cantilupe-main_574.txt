John  de  Beccles, notary-public, announces  in the presence of  the 
                   Bishop  and  others that  the Archbishop  of Canterbury  has 
                   deferred to the appeal from  his judgment  as  Judge delegate 
                   made  to the Papal Court by Wilham   de Ludlow,  the Bishop's 
                   Proctor, on the ground that he had unjustly rejected the pleas 
                   and defence of the Bishop.   The  Archbishop fixes a term for 
                   the appearance of the Suttors before the Pope or his Audstor, 
                   and for the statement of the case for the higher Court.  The 
                   Proctor of the  Bishop of  St. Asaph   expressed assent. The 
                   record ts to be duly forwarded, and  the Priors of Alberbury 
                   and Chirbury  are instructed to defend the rights of the Church 
                   in Gordwyr  and  elsewhere.
