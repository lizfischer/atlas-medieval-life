No. 1375. 1329, Saturday, July 15. AGREEMENT made between Adam, bishop of Worcester, and Stephen, dean, and the chapter of Hereford. The church of Schinyngfeld' with the chapel of Swalefeld' had long been leased to the said dominus Adam as long as he was bishop of Hereford at an annual rent of twenty pounds, when the said dominus Adam became bishop of Worcester, the lease was renewed to him for his lifetime on the same terms. But when he learned through magistri Richard de Vernoun, and Roger de Breynton', canons of the church of Hereford, of the ruinous condition of that church, dominus Adam offered to pay an additional twenty pounds of annual rent to be used for the fabric of the church and for no other purpose. He further bound himself to support all the burdens falling upon the said church and chapel, as was contained in the first articles of agreement. Given at Bredon', in the diocese of Worcester. Latin.
