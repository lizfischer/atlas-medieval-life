LETTER from John de Ros, clerk, to the dean and chapter of Hereford. The writer states fnat he is at the command of the dean and chapter, and bids them write to him to make their wishes known. He sends to them magister Adam Murymouthâ€™ who has faithfully dispatched their affairs. It is agreed between the writer and the said magister Adam as to the method of procedure which the judges delegated in their cause will adopt; and what answer may made to the libel of the dean and chapter, because the writer's proctor has all these things in written form; likewise what kind of sentence the judges ought to give; there will be no appeal against it. The writer wishes that the dean and chapter could prove what they say in their articles about the great commons. His own information is otherwise. In the dispute (factum?) between the bishop and magister William de Ros, archdeacon of Salop, the writer sends by Roger Digge, his servant, three definitive sentences brought against the bishop; also instruments concerning the condemnation of expenses; also an executory bull and executory processes to proceed against the bishop if he refuses to obey the said sentences; aiso one process is sent to the dean and chapter without ecclesiastical penalty or censure. Written at Avignon. Latin.
