May   18.—Writ   forbidding the bishop to execute any  process from 
                         the Roman   court against William  de Cusancia  and  Nicholas 
                         de Neuton.   The  king, in pursuance  of the ancient rights of 
                         the Crown  during the vacancy  of the see of Exeter, presented 
                          William de Cusaneia  to  the archdeaconry  of Cornwall  and 
                         a  vacant prebend.   A   suit by the  bishop a   Exeter  was 
                         decided by  the court in the king's favour and  William  was 
                         duly  admitted, and  long held quiet possession, but has since, 
                         with  Nicholas de Neuton,  been subjected to litigation outside 
                         the kingdom at the instigation of certain of the king’s enemtes, 
                         and  has been condemned  in enormous  and  unreasonable costs.
