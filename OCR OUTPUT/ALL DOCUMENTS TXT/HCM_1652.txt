LETTER of Edward [II] to the abbot and convent of St. Peter's, Gloucester, reciting that he wishes to provide a suitable means of sustenance for Walter Mantel his servant. He had on several occasions asked the abbot and convent to receive the said Walter Mantel into their monastery in place of Roger de Cestr', now deceased, whom they had received into their house and supported at the request of Edward I. The abbot and convent had offered the excuse that they had previously taken in a certain William Geraud, whom they were still supporting. The king considers this excuse insufficient because they had accepted the said William before the king's succession to the throne, and repeats his request that they accept the said Walter Mantel, and maintain him. They are to deliver their letters patent to this effect to the said Walter. Given at Lincoln. Latin.
