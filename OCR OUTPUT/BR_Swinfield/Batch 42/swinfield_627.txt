Oct. 4.â€”The   bishop excuses himself, on the ground of  weak  health, 
                         for  absence at the synod  of  Oct. 9th, and appoints  Andrew 
                          de Brugge  and  Robert  de Iklesham  as proctors to  represent 
                          him  in  the presence of the cardinal of  Sancta  Prisca and 
                          the bishop of Poitiers!
