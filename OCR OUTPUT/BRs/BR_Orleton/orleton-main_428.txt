The  Bishop sends  to the Prior of Ludlow  a copy of his reply to the 
                                     burgesses, and  warns  him   that, tf the  facts are true,  he 
                                     should not, to the scandal of others, refuse to the dead what 
                                    pity  and  humanity  require.
